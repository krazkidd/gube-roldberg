	- Changed user space significantly. Parts now use dimensions in meters instead
	  of pixels. The world is now zoomable. 

25.02.2011 v2.0.1
	- Modified Updateable on Updateable collisions so that they are inelastic instead
	  of elastic. There is less bounciness but also less craziness (balls would 
	  perpetually bounce when there was a pile of them; floating point calcs. and
	  poor collision detection algorithm would allow large amounts of energy to 
	  suddenly appear in the system and make things go crazy)
	  
XX.02.2011 v2.0.0
	- Stripped the old code down to the bare essentials. Moved classes and methods
	  around to separate the engine from the game. Modified calculations so they would
	  run a little faster and used a design pattern or two to make things go really fast.
