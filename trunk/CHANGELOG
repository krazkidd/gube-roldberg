	- Polygon collisions were fixed.
	- Ramps are not being created correctly; they are spawned with weird dimensions.
	- Circle-Circle collisions work great, but when there are Polygons, sometimes
	  all the Parts just disappear (NaN position)

13.06.2011
	- All collisions now use one of two possible CollisionResult objects. This saves
	  a lot of time by not having to create and destroy them every time through the
	  update loop.

10.06.2011
	- Changed user space significantly. Parts now use dimensions in meters instead
	  of pixels. The world is now zoomable. 
	- Timestep made to be static. I suppose this could be changeable by the user.

25.02.2011 v2.0.1
	- Modified Updateable on Updateable collisions so that they are inelastic instead
	  of elastic. There is less bounciness but also less craziness (balls would 
	  perpetually bounce when there was a pile of them; floating point calcs. and
	  poor collision detection algorithm would allow large amounts of energy to 
	  suddenly appear in the system and make things go crazy)
	  
XX.02.2011 v2.0.0
	- Stripped the old code down to the bare essentials. Moved classes and methods
	  around to separate the engine from the game. Modified calculations so they would
	  run a little faster and used a design pattern or two to make things go really fast.
